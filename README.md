## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the Mid-Side Transform Module for FPGA! This guide will help you download and run our software easily, even if you have no technical background. Follow the steps below to set up your audio processing module.

## 📦 What is Mid-Side Transform?

Mid-Side transform is a method used in audio signal processing to improve sound quality. It splits a stereo audio signal into two components: the mid (sum of left and right audio) and the side (difference between left and right audio). Our module, created in Verilog, allows you to encode and decode this signal using your FPGA hardware.

## 🛠️ Features

- **RTL Design**: Verilog-based implementation for efficient processing.
- **AXI-Stream Control**: Smooth communication with high-speed data transfers.
- **AXI-Lite Control**: Easy configuration for your system.
- **Cycle-Accurate Simulation**: Verified results on the KV260 platform to ensure reliable performance.

## 🌟 System Requirements

To run the Mid-Side Transform Module, ensure you have the following:

- **Hardware**: 
  - Xilinx Kria KV260 Development Kit
- **Software**: 
  - Xilinx Vivado for design synthesis
  - Xilinx SDK for program development

Once you've downloaded the software, follow these steps:

1. **Extract the Files**: 
   - Locate the downloaded ZIP file on your computer.
   - Right-click the file and choose "Extract" or "Unzip."
   - Open the extracted folder.

2. **Set Up the Project**:
   - Open Xilinx Vivado.
   - Select "Open Project" and navigate to the folder where you extracted the files.
   - Choose the project file to load it into Vivado.

3. **Check the Connections**:
   - Make sure the KV260 board is properly connected to your computer.
   - Confirm that all necessary drivers are installed.

4. **Synthesize the Design**:
   - In Vivado, click on "Synthesis" and then "Run Synthesis."
   - Wait for the process to complete. This will prepare the design for your FPGA.

5. **Program the FPGA**:
   - After synthesis, navigate to "Program and Debug."
   - Click "Program Device" and follow the prompts to load the design onto the KV260.

6. **Test the Module**:
   - Once the programming is complete, connect your audio inputs and outputs.
   - Use your audio setup to play sound and ensure the Mid-Side transform is functioning as expected.
